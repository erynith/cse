- [StremioAddon](https://github.com/erynith/cse/tree/master/StremioAddon) - Allows you to use any Stremio addon by pasting their manifest.json url. Supports 5 addon urls

I recommend using it from [cloudstream-extensions-phisher](https://github.com/phisher98/cloudstream-extensions-phisher) since this repo is more for debugging my extension rather than stable use
